# Introduction
Hello, and welcome to a guide I am making for anyone interested in learning programming.

This guide will (eventually) contain pretty much everything I know about programming, and will continue to grow and improve as that knowledge expands

## Why make this?
I am making this for a few reasons:
- People ask me all the time "how do I learn programming", or "what are some good resources to learn programming", or "can I learn programming for free". I want to be able to point these people to a resource I trust
- A lot of programming guides and tutorials online are not comprehensive unless they are paid for. Many resources online are great but are usually not up to date and way too language specific
- I feel a lot of despair in the programming community about concepts that quite frankly should not be that difficult to teach, yet are still a pain point for many. This results in people discounting large portions of computer science/software engineering as "useless", and lots of frustration ensues
- A way to keep things I have learned in one place

Basically I want to help people learn with a methodology that I believe in, with a source that I can control and change as I see fit

## Why should you read this?
Honestly, I have no justification. I am not an expert at programming; I am pretty good, but there is still much for me to learn. I am also not an expert at teaching, nor do I have any experience in that.

What I do have is a passion for programming, and I was lucky enough to have some good teachers early on, so some of this will contain their knowledge. The rest will come from my experience and what I feel is important to teach, in an order that I think is unique and effective.

## Who should read this
- You know how to use a computer to a basic - intermediate degree
    - You need to know copy paste, right click, navigate and use the computer
    - You don't need to know what a kernel is, how the internet works, or what processor architecture you have currently
- You have an interest in learning programming and want to start *now*
- You have anywhere from complete ignorance to total and complete knowledge of programming
    - Feel free to skip around if you feel the beginning sections are too basic
- You have access to a web browser and an internet connection
    - Not a single part of this guide will require a local work environment, **with the sole exception of the section on developer environments**, which is an important topic which will require some sort of local filesystem (so not really possible on a chromebook for example)
    - If you don't access to this
- You have a willingness to work through challenges and difficulty
    - Anyone can learn programming, and I don't think it is that difficult to do so. However, writing good software is hard, like *really* hard. Sure, you can create something that works, but that is very different from a masterfully architected, scalable, and elegant solutions. 
    - It is very easy to confuse the two: just because you learned something does not mean it will be easy to apply it. I will try my best to give you the tools and knowledge to make this possible, but it will require your effort in the end
- You are willing to trust the process, at least to a certain degree
    - I mentioned earlier that the order of this guide is a bit strange compared to most tutorials, but I want you to follow it in order if you are a beginner
