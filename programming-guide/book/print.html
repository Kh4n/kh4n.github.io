<p>Hello, and welcome to a guide I am making for anyone interested in learning programming.</p>
<p>This guide will (eventually) contain pretty much everything I know about programming, and will continue to grow and improve as that knowledge expands</p>
<h2 id="why-make-this"><a class="header" href="#why-make-this">Why make this?</a></h2>
<p>I am making this for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>People ask me all the time &quot;how do I learn programming&quot;, or &quot;what are some good resources to learn programming&quot;, or &quot;can I learn programming for free&quot;. I want to be able to point these people to a resource I trust</li>
<li>A lot of programming guides and tutorials online are not comprehensive unless they are paid for. Many resources online are great but are usually not up to date and way too language specific</li>
<li>I feel a lot of despair in the programming community about concepts that quite frankly should not be that difficult to teach, yet are still a pain point for many. This results in people discounting large portions of computer science/software engineering as &quot;useless&quot;, and lots of frustration ensues</li>
<li>A way to keep things I have learned in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically I want to help people learn with a methodology that I believe in, with a source that I can control and change as I see fit</p>
<h2 id="why-should-you-read-this"><a class="header" href="#why-should-you-read-this">Why should you read this?</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, I have no justification. I am not an expert at programming; I am pretty good, but there is still much for me to learn. I am also not an expert at teaching, nor do I have any experience in that.</p>
<p>What I do have is a passion for programming, and I was lucky enough to have some good teachers early on, so some of this will contain their knowledge. The rest will come from my experience and what I feel is important to teach, in an order that I think is unique and effective.</p>
<h2 id="who-should-read-this"><a class="header" href="#who-should-read-this">Who should read this</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>You know how to use a computer to a basic - intermediate degree
<ul>
<li>You need to know copy paste, right click, navigate and use the computer</li>
<li>You don't need to know what a kernel is, how the internet works, or what processor architecture you have currently</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have an interest in learning programming and want to start <em>now</em></li>
<li>You have anywhere from complete ignorance to total and complete knowledge of programming
<ul>
<li>Feel free to skip around if you feel the beginning sections are too basic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have access to a web browser and an internet connection
<ul>
<li>Not a single part of this guide will require a local work environment, <strong>with the sole exception of the section on developer environments</strong>, which is an important topic which will require some sort of local filesystem (so not really possible on a chromebook for example)</li>
<li>If you don't access to this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have a willingness to work through challenges and difficulty
<ul>
<li>Anyone can learn programming, and I don't think it is that difficult to do so. However, writing good software is hard, like <em>really</em> hard. Sure, you can create something that works, but that is very different from a masterfully architected, scalable, and elegant solutions. </li>
<li>It is very easy to confuse the two: just because you learned something does not mean it will be easy to apply it. I will try my best to give you the tools and knowledge to make this possible, but it will require your effort in the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You are willing to trust the process, at least to a certain degree
<ul>
<li>I mentioned earlier that the order of this guide is a bit strange compared to most tutorials, but I want you to follow it in order if you are a beginner</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pedagogy"><a class="header" href="#pedagogy">Pedagogy</a></h1>
<p>Here I will explain some of the choices that I made with regard to this guide. Feel free to skip this section if you don't care about this; it is not important to read this if you are just trying to learn programming.</p>
<h2 id="language-order"><a class="header" href="#language-order">Language order</a></h2>
<p>On first glance, the order of languages chosen seems a little bizarre. Python first makes total sense, but C next? Isn't that an &quot;advanced&quot; programming language? Also isn't Java beginner friendly, shouldn't we be learning that first?</p>
<p>Here is my explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python: this is a great first language. It has very few pitfalls, is easy to pick up, and can let beginners feel the &quot;joy of programming&quot;.
<ul>
<li>Another huge advantage is that I can teach a huge part of this language without doing the &quot;you'll learn about this in depth later so just take it at face value for now&quot; thing which I really hate. I will have to do that a few times as it is unavoidable, but Python first really mitigates that</li>
<li>Python has few pitfalls, but is not completely devoid of them, so there may be slightly better choices, but I am really experienced with Python so it makes sense to me to use it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>C: this is the weird one. The core reasoning behind this is due to what C and Java are supposed to teach
<ul>
<li>Here is what I am using each to teach, which is pretty common in general as well:
<ul>
<li>C is to help people learn low level concepts and create a core understanding about how a computer works and how languages interact with the computer</li>
<li>Java is to help understand OOP and software design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My key takeaway after learning these languages in the opposite order many years ago is this:
<strong>the concepts in C are deceptively <em>easy</em> to learn, while the concepts in Java are deceptively <em>difficult</em> to learn</strong>
<ul>
<li>Computer internals may seem intimidating at first but are really straightforward to understand at a medium-high level and give an excellent baseline to learn other languages that abstract over these concepts</li>
<li>Software design is very different: it is hard to understand properly, hard to apply, and the best practices are changing rapidly all the time. OOP may seem easy at first to beginners: &quot;just make correlations to real world objects&quot;. But this methodology completely falls apart in the real world and results in some really, <em>really</em> bad design that can frustrate newcomers to the field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Java: this may also seem strange given its age, but it is still one of the most in demand languages, and is pretty simple when it comes to software design
<ul>
<li>Other languages have too many sophisticated features that can clutter understanding</li>
<li>Learning C first means we don't need to be confused by objects vs primitives and what not</li>
<li>A kind of underrated language these days: everyone hates on it (I used to as well), but I have come to appreciate its simplicity, even if it is a bit verbose
<ul>
<li>The newer APIs in the language are also a big boon</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="avoiding-the-well-come-back-to-this-later-phenomenon"><a class="header" href="#avoiding-the-well-come-back-to-this-later-phenomenon">Avoiding the &quot;we'll come back to this later&quot; phenomenon</a></h2>
<p>I mentioned earlier that I really hate this phrase in tutorials: it can be hard as a learner to just ignore the fact that you are using something you can't fully understand. As stated, I can't totally avoid this, but I will try very hard to reduce this phrase as much as possible. Here are the ways I will mitigate this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python first will allow us to get the basics down without much trouble</li>
<li>I will try to give high level explanations that will allow you to &quot;black box&quot; things effectively</li>
<li>I will go in depth right at the spot as much as I can without it being too tiresome</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-goals-and-general-ideas"><a class="header" href="#other-goals-and-general-ideas">Other goals and general ideas</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>I want to make this easy to read and not tiresome</li>
<li>I want to make it approachable and not intimidating</li>
<li>I want to make it fluid when reading but still work as decently as a reference
<ul>
<li>The main focus is straightforward reading, as maintaining a reference is difficult, but I want people to be able to come back to certain sections if there is something they forgot or want to reread</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do not want people to just memorize things and move on, so I will make that as hard as I can by giving as few things to memorize as possible</li>
<li>I do not want large code sections, especially not at the beginning
<ul>
<li>I want to discourage copy/paste as much as possible</li>
<li>Also newcomers tend to glaze over when seeing a wall of code
<ul>
<li>Hell, I feel my eyes start to glaze over sometimes :)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I do not want a tutorial &quot;feel&quot; to this guide. Tutorials are kind of bad as they are perpetually out of date and tend to encourage copy/paste as well as lack of understanding
<ul>
<li>Instead, I want people to learn and understand core concepts and be able to apply them freely to their own projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dos-and-donts"><a class="header" href="#dos-and-donts">Do's and Dont's</a></h1>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="basics"><a class="header" href="#basics">Basics</a></h1>
<p>Here we will learn the basics of Python as well as programming in general. What is a keyword? What is a function? What is a variable? Things like that. Read on to get started.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="hello-world"><a class="header" href="#hello-world">Hello World</a></h1>
<p>Ah, the pinnacle of programming. Every programmer starts with a &quot;hello world&quot; program, as will you. Let's get started.</p>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<p>Here I will be making a shift: many tutorials start with an agonizing development environment setup that can suck the joy out of many a beginner (or even experienced) programmer. Instead, we will be using the glory of an <strong>Online IDE</strong>. Fear not, it will have all the features you need, will be fully setup, and can be accessed from anywhere you have a browser.</p>
<p>You are free to use any online IDE, but I strongly recommend <a href="http://repl.it">Replit</a>, as it is free and easy to use. Sign up, create a new Repl, make sure to select Python. It should be Python version 3. You will see a code editor on the left. Here is what mine looks like (it may look different):
<img src="python/basics/../img/replit-screenshot.png" alt="Replit Screenshot" /></p>
<p>You see I have some code in the left side:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys
print(sys.version_info.major)
</code></pre>
<p>Paste this in to whatever IDE or editor you are using, Replit or otherwise, and ensure that after you run (the green &quot;Run&quot; button in the case of Replit) the console on the right outputs a &quot;3&quot;. This is to make sure we are on Python 3, and not 2. If you get an error, you are on the wrong version.</p>
<p>Ignore the other files that are there, and do not open them or edit them. They are not relevant.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: As a note to yourself for the distant future: do not <em>ever</em> write proprietary code in an online IDE, or any code that you want to own yourself. It is not safe from a legal or security standpoint, please do not do it. I will show you how to properly set up your environment locally later on, and it is not even that hard. It's just that right now I want to get you started as quickly as possible, and this is the best way to do that. The code you will write as a beginner will not be so important tha you need to copyright it, but in the future it may be.</p>
<p>Now that you are on the right version, delete that code and pretend that you never ran it, because now we will write our first legitimate piece of software.</p>
<h2 id="the-actual-code"><a class="header" href="#the-actual-code">The actual code</a></h2>
<p>In the editor, type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>and hit run. You should see the words printed on the right like so:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>This output area is known as the console. Later on we will discuss what is going on in more depth, as even a simple hello world program has much to be explained. Suffice it to say, the console is where you will see your program output, as it is (usually) very easy to output text to it in most languages, Python included. In fact, in Python it is only one line as you can see here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-just-happened"><a class="header" href="#what-just-happened">What just happened?</a></h1>
<p>So what is going on here? Let's go through them one by one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><code>print</code>: this is a <strong>function</strong> which tells the computer to output text to the console</li>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World&quot;</code>: this is called a <em>string</em>, which we need to surround with quotes. The reason we need to surround this with quotes will become apparent in a moment when we introduce variables.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="experiment"><a class="header" href="#experiment">Experiment!</a></h2>
<p>Before we go into functions and variables, feel free to experiment around and change the string's contents. Only add alphanumeric stuff for now (A-Z, a-z, 0-9). Like so, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello &lt;your name&gt;&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>Feel free to substitute your name in here.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Whenever you see something like <code>&lt;put stuff here&gt;</code>, that means replace that <em>entire</em> thing with what you want to put in, including the angle brackets. For the example above, if your name was Khan, you would put:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello Khan&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>and not</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">print(&quot;Hello &lt;Khan&gt;&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a common pattern across many guides and documentation in general so remember it. You may see the angle brackets replaces with square brackets (<code>[]</code>) or braces (<code>{}</code>). The rule remains the same (almost always).</p>
<p>In any case, for every section, feel free to tweak the examples a bit
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Be sure to copy and paste these examples for now, as I do not want you to have errors yet. We will get into those shortly as well. If you get an error while experimenting do not worry about it, things will make more sense as we go.</p>
<h2 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h2>
<p>Before we get into functions and how to understand them, lets explore variables a bit. Copy and paste this next piece of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ourStr = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
print(ourStr)
</code></pre>
<p>You should see:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>as expected. So it should now be clearer as to why we need quotes: when something does not have quotes, it means something <em>different</em>, in this case a variable.</p>
<p>Going through the first line:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ourStr</code>: this is the variable we are assigning to</li>
<li><code>=</code>: the assignment <em>operator</em>. Tells Python &quot;we want to assign something&quot;</li>
<li><code>&quot;Hello World!</code>: the value we want to assign</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example we took a string and stored it the variable <code>ourStr</code>. You can visualize it like so:
<img src="python/basics/../img/variables.svg" alt="Variables Visualized" /></p>
<p><code>ourStr</code> is a kind of container for the <em>value</em> of &quot;Hello World!&quot;. It is not &quot;Hello World!&quot; itself. That is an important distinction. We can have multiple variables with the same value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ourStr = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
ourStr2 = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
print(ourStr)
print(ourStr2)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!
Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>We can also reassign the variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ourStr = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
ourStr = &quot;Hello World again!&quot;
print(ourStr)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World again!
</code></pre>
<p>We will learn more about variables as we go along, but in python they are truly quite simple and straightforward as you see here.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="more-on-variables"><a class="header" href="#more-on-variables">More on Variables</a></h1>
<p>Let's learn a bit more about different values variables can take, namely their <em>types</em>, as well as a bit about functions.</p>
<h2 id="variables-and-values"><a class="header" href="#variables-and-values">Variables and Values</a></h2>
<p>Earlier we assigned a string to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">ourStr = &quot;Hello World!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, lets try a number and a <em>boolean</em>. Run the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 2
b = True
print(a)
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>2
True
</code></pre>
<p>We can do operations on these values as well, try this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = 3 + 3
b = a - 10
print(b)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>-4
</code></pre>
<p>Try experimenting with other math expressions! For booleans, here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = True
b = False
c = a or b
d = a and b
e = a and not b
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>True
False
True
</code></pre>
<p>This should make logical sense: True or False (either needs to be true) means True. True and False (both need to be true) means false. For <code>e</code>, we negated the False, making it True, thereby following the same logic as <code>c</code>. Don't think about these too much: boolean expressions make more sense over time and in general do not get very complicated.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-strings"><a class="header" href="#what-about-strings">What about strings?</a></h2>
<p>Well, strings have operations as well:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">a = &quot;Hello&quot;
b = &quot; World!&quot;
print(a + b)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>There are more, but we will get into those after we learn about functions</p>
<p>Variables are important, but the next section which talks about functions is even more important to understand. I had to introduce variables first though, as it would be cumbersome to explain them at the same time as functions.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>Functions are, in my opinion, the most important thing to understand when it comes to programming. Thinking about things in terms of functions can help immensely as you go along. The good news is that they are quite easy to understand.</p>
<h2 id="the-print-function"><a class="header" href="#the-print-function">The <code>print</code> function</a></h2>
<p>I could jump in and try to explain this function, but I think it is actually better if we take a slight detour and make our own function first, and then come back to this</p>
<h2 id="your-first-function"><a class="header" href="#your-first-function">Your first function</a></h2>
<p>Copy and paste this into your editor and hit run:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def add(a, b):
    return a + b

num1 = 12
num2 = 5
output = add(num1, num2)
print(output)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>17
</code></pre>
<p>Whew! A lot going on here. Let's break it down line by line again:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>def add(a, b)</code>
<ol>
<li><code>def</code>: this is what we call a <em>keyword</em>, or a <em>reserved word</em>. It tells Python that we are about to define a function</li>
<li><code>add</code>: this is the name of our function</li>
<li><code>a, b</code>: this is a comma separated list of <em>parameters</em> to our function which serve as variables we can access in the body of the function</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>return a + b</code>: this is probably the weirdest part. <code>return</code> is another keyword, which serves to tell Python that we want to output the expression after it back to whoever called the function. We cannot add any more lines after this, which makes sense because we have already output something back to the user</li>
<li><code>output = add(num1, num2)</code>: here we <em>called</em> our function with the variables we made earlier, and assigned its output to the variable <code>output</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This is quite a bit, so make sure to take it all in. Essentially, to make a function, we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give it a name</li>
<li>Give it some parameters, any number (even none at all!)</li>
<li>Give it a body where we do some stuff</li>
<li>Optionally return a value</li>
</ol>
<p>These are all valid functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def subtract(a, b):
    return b - a

def sayHello():
    print(&quot;Hello&quot;)

def areaOfTriangle(base, height):
    return (1/2) * base * height
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the code in the function does not execute until we actually call it, which we do by adding a set of parentheses enclosing our <em>arguments</em>. This is an important distinction! When the variables are in the first set of parentheses after the function name (the <code>def</code> part), commonly referred to the <em>definition</em> of the function (hence the keyword &quot;def&quot;) they are called parameters, but when you use variables to call a function, they are called <em>arguments</em>.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-visualize-functions"><a class="header" href="#how-to-visualize-functions">How to visualize functions</a></h2>
<p>I recommend using a &quot;black box&quot; method. That is, think of the function as a black box which takes some input and magically spits out something. So our add function might look like this:
<img src="python/basics/../img/add.svg" alt="Addition Function" /></p>
<p>It is not important for anyone else to know what is happening inside the function, all they know is they put two numbers in and this function adds them. This is an important reoccurring concept. For this case we know exactly whats happening because we wrote it, but if you are reading someone else's code you can take their (hopefully descriptive) function name at face value. Now you might be thinking, what does the <code>print</code> function black box look like? Maybe something like this:
<img src="python/basics/../img/print-wrong.svg" alt="Print Function Wrong Visualization" /></p>
<p>This is wrong! I will explain why.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-our-friend-the-print-function"><a class="header" href="#back-to-our-friend-the-print-function">Back to our friend the <code>print</code> function</a></h2>
<p>So why was the above visualization wrong? Well remember how I said functions have outputs? Let's see what the <code>output</code> of print is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def add(a, b):
    return a + b

out = add(2, 3)
print(out)
out = print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
print(out)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>5
Hello World!
None
</code></pre>
<p>Huh??? What is <code>None</code>? Why was that the output of <code>print</code>?</p>
<p>Let's start with the <code>None</code> thing: Python has the concept of a value that means &quot;nothing&quot;, or that &quot;there is no value&quot;. This may sound weird at first until we consider the fact that this is super useful to have and exists everywhere:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers have a 0, because we want to know when we have 0 of something, just like when we have 2 or 200 of something</li>
<li>The languages we speak all have words for &quot;nothing&quot;, because again, we need to know when we have...nothing! It would be weird and hard to understand if there was an empty pause every time we meant to say nothing</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, why was the output <code>None</code>? Well that is because <code>print</code> actually does not output (<code>return</code>) anything. We can make a function ourselves that returns nothing to prove this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def nothing():
    return None

output = nothing()
print(output)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>None
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, in Python, if we do not have a return statement, or simply leave the expression after <code>return</code> blank, it automatically makes it return <code>None</code>. Note that this is a language specific thing, and not every language operates like this. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def nothing():
    return

out = nothing()
print(out)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>None
</code></pre>
<h2 id="so-if-print-does-not-return-anything-why-is-there-output-in-the-console"><a class="header" href="#so-if-print-does-not-return-anything-why-is-there-output-in-the-console">So if <code>print</code> does not <code>return</code> anything, why is there output in the console</a></h2>
<p>Additionally, why do our functions that actually return things not show up in the console? Why do we need to use <code>print</code> afterwards?</p>
<p>So here is where the black box analogy can struggle: the <code>print</code> function actually affects things <em>outside</em> of the function itself. Basically, unlike our <code>add</code> function up there which was only touching the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables it defined, the <code>print</code> function affected things that were not in the input, and used those <em>side effects</em> to make things appear in our console. If that sounds confusing, don't worry, it is a bit tricky. But basically, we can instead visualize our <code>print</code> function with the concept of hidden inputs and outputs:</p>
<p><img src="python/basics/../img/print-correct.svg" alt="Print Function, better Visualization" /></p>
<p>For now, don't worry about how it actually shows up to the console, or where this hidden output is. You'll learn about that in later sections. Many times people just forget about this way of visualizing functions because of this inconvenience. However, I promise it is worth it to use this slightly weird concept of hidden inputs and outputs instead to make the visualization work.</p>
<p>For now, just know that:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>print</code> does not return anything</li>
<li>Even though it has one input, there are other things it is affecting</li>
<li>You can visualize those other things as hidden inputs/outputs, even though Python does not actually have the concept of hidden inputs and outputs</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wow-functions-sound-like-a-real-pain-i-think-ill-avoid-them"><a class="header" href="#wow-functions-sound-like-a-real-pain-i-think-ill-avoid-them">Wow! Functions sound like a real pain! I think I'll avoid them...</a></h2>
<p>NO! Functions are way to useful to let some new keywords and hidden inputs/outputs to scare you away. They let you define things in one place and use them over and over. The <code>add</code> example seems pointless, but that is because Python gives you a builtin <code>add</code> function, the <code>+</code>, so it is kind of redundant. But if we were doing something even slight complicated like the volume of a cylinder function I wrote earlier, we can reuse that logic over and over to save ourselves time and make our code cleaner and easier to <em>maintain</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def areaOfTriangle(base, height):
    return (1/2) * base * height

vol1 = areaOfTriangle(4, 10)
print(vol1)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>20.0
</code></pre>
<p>This is still pretty basic, but it is easier to read, and most importantly if we ever need to change the logic for <code>areaOfTriangle</code>, its already all in one spot which makes things easier.</p>
